# Dalitso P. Nyanda - Personal Website

This is my personal website, designed and implemented as part of [CS50W's Project 0](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2019/x/projects/0/project0.html) in June 2020.

The website contains my CV and my information. The website is written in HTML with CSS / SCSS styling. A small amount of JavaScript is used to generate a pop-up when a button is activated (Programming page).



## Website Files:

The website is composed of 4 `.html` pages (Index (i.e. a homepage), CV, Programming, and Publications). `.html` files are located in the top level of the directory; JavaScript files are stored in  the `/scripts` directory; images, icons, and PDFs in `/images`; and CSS / SCSS files in `/styles`.

## Specifications:

The website complies with all of the [CS50W Project 0 requirements](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2019/x/projects/0/project0.html), containing 4 `.html` pages, Bootstrap 4, SCSS nesting, etc. The website is also responsive i.e. it can be viewed on multiple devices with various screen sizes, adjusting content as appropriate.
